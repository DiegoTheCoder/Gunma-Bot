# Discord Bot
This is my discord bot for server.  
Default prefix is: --
## Commands / Usage

**prefix?**: Saying this exactly will have the bot tell the current prefix it requires.

**--newprefix** *prefix* : Changes the command prefix to *prefix*. This is persistant so last prefix it was changed to will be required to change it again or use other commands.

**--newrole** *role_id* *"desired_response"*: will make the bot respond with the response to anyone with the role id. Will overwrite previous response if same role is used. Make sure the desired_response is in quotes if more than one word.

**--delrole** *role_id*: will delete the response for the role id and make it not happen again.

~~**--newid** *person_id* *"desired_response"*:  Bot will use desired_response whenever person_id talks. Will overwrite previus response if same id is used. Make sure the desired_response is in quotes if more than one word.~~

~~**--delid** *person_id*: will delete the response for the person id and make it not happen again.~~
